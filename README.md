# TImageLibrary
A terribly python image library I made to flex on my friend who doesn't know linear algebra

## To Use
just clone this repo somewhere in path and then use import timg to access functions
## Syntax
Coordinates are returned as tuples formatted (x,y), however you can use (y,x) and it will work fine so long as you are consistent
Most functions return a list of points that can be used to draw onto a canvas.  Some example code is provided
